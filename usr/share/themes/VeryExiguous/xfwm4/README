Very Exiguous
----
Based on the Exiguous theme, which is based on the Minimalistic theme, which is based on the Opta theme.  
All window buttons and such look identical, so you've either gotta learn your
WM shortcuts or button positions.  Your windows will be 1px smaller than 
your screen in all directions when maximised.

Please don't hesitate to contact me to provide any suggestions or request
modification.

Based on Opta theme. No window buttons, very narrow titlebar. Theme for those
who know their keyboard shortcuts well and don't want to waste a single pixel
of space on their desktop.
